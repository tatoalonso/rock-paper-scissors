rock-paper-scissors
Rock paper scissors classic game played by you against the machine.

Rock paper scissors (also known as paper scissors rock, scissors rock paper, paper rock scissors, or scissors paper stone) is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace").

It has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other.

A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors, but will lose to one who has played paper ; a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors . If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.

In this version you play against the machine which makes its choice in a randomly way.
